This directory contains both CardPictures (mostly for users reference) and CardData which are .json files that describe the cards mechanics.

To find something, the tree is the following:

CardData/CardPictures -> **\[expansion\]** -> **\[class\]**

There's also an *index.csv* file in base directory that correlates the card number (id) with the corresponding card type and expansion/class for the program to easily find the desired card
