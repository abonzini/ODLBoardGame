Ongoing tasks in order of priority:

- Action phase:
		- Either override or extend CardGetter to be able to return test cards.
			- Cards number 00 to -99 -> Playable bricks, procedurally created as G-TGT, gold cost and target, effect, none
			- Cards number -01111 to -99999 -> Playable token units, procedurally generated as G-HP-ATK-MVT-DEN
			- Cards number -100000000 to -199999999 -> Playable token buildings, procedurally generated as 1-G-HP-[bPlain-bForest-bMountain](packed 18-bit binary, 4-6-8bit)
		- New system tests, based on CardPlayabilityTest, checking if can afford, etc, use card getter override as test cases
		- Do your best here to check many types of errors and so on, go function by function (verify and play), and ensure correct returns and correct states
		- For valid play, also verify new step (non-null) and newest state is also action
	- Then, need to implement the actual playing, including remove the card from hand (new ENGINE) and proper behaviour, step by step (slooooowly)
	- Rush as special case, add rush flag, which secretly is playing a card, flag is cleaned at EOT as new event (or BOT/Draw? We'll see)
- Play a card
	- - Do Spell-Unit-Bldg, first effects are silly but they increase, once units are summoned, present in building and so on we can move on
- Board:
	- Implementing units and buildings as part of previous task, extend to basic board permanence
	- Board test, eventually will become one of the main tests regarding combat and overall board state
- EOT phase:
	- Transistion to next player (no EOT eff for now)
	- Start thinking about marching, and tiredness flags, attacking, stepping, starting march, etc
- Implement cards, one by one, add tests
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Todo...
	- Lots of individual mechanics that will be polished as it goes, individual card testing
