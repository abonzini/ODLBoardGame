Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Finish implementing stat class:
    - Aply stat class to all entities
    - Build project, use Total in all calculations
    - Resolve chain cloning of Entities and inheriting (for stat)
    - Modify deserialization readme for cards
-Implementing Buffing/Debuffing:
    - Add STAT state amchine, deals with buffing and changing stats overall, with functions such as doubling stats or etc. Passes through engine (for reversion). Stat as reference
    - In triginter, add effects that buff a stat for target(s)
        - Value (already there)
        - Stat to change (of target)
        - Type of buff (setting, addition, multiplication, hard setting)
        - HP buffing situation, need a HP verification on top
    - Tests:
        - Given: specific target(s): Massive test case of all stat buffing/debuffing with the chosen proportion, all stats, all situations
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
