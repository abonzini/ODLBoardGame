Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- 4,5:
	- New trigger subscription "on current tile", test it with initialization of a unit/building and popping debug on the tile
	- New modifier targets as the current march value and init_march flag (readonly), then a trigger related to "marching in tile" context, including beginning of march or marching through, test by reading both march values, doing some operation and popping cpu stack, value should corroborate
	- #4 and #5 as buildings with simple "on current tile" trigger. One asserts enemy, not in initial march and multiplies by 0. Other just filters ally and adds +1 to march
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
