Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Card maker UI:
	- rest of card stats
	- draw blueprint
	- save image function
	- events and triggers rest of stuff
	- export json
	- import json
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
