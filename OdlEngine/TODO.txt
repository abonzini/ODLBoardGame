Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Buildings
	- Buildings also summoned, more complex behaviour as BP are involved and only one building can be placed
		- Cards number -1000000000 to -1999999999 -> Playable token buildings, procedurally generated as 1-G-HP-[bPlain-bForest-bMountain](packed 18-bit binary, 4-6-8bit)-TGT
	- Bldg damage
- Implement complex effects:
	- Events (when an effect occurs globally and triggers a unit, e.g. EOT). Loaded as dict <EventType, List<Entity>> of entities with the effect. This can be serialized, non-hashed.
	- Filters?
	---
	- Buff tokens
	- Buff tok is just extra fields (hashable and serializable) on the placeable
- Deck-out
- Stealth, implementation of the 2 stealth cards too
	- Stealth play is in PLAYABLE_ in otder to get other valid targets (needed?) or just re-do idk, however it does instance number of units, but they're filtered out in player's unit count
	- Proper correlations, to not break stuff
	- Avancement, more complex advancment logic including non-decrementing counter if unit revealed, i.e. check for advance, advance result, and switch this instead of the thign in the tile.
	- Stealth breaking when unit has an interaction with other entities that change somethign other than themselves
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Todo...
	- Lots of individual mechanics that will be polished as it goes, individual card testing
