Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Implement complex effects:
	- Events (when an effect occurs globally and triggers a unit, e.g. EOT). Loaded as dict <EventType, List<Entity>> of entities with the effect. This can be serialized, non-hashed.
	- Filters?
	---
	- Buff tokens
	- Buff tok is just extra fields (hashable and serializable) on the placeable
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
