Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Targeting mechanics:
  - Add tons of targeting test scenarios, ensure debug ctx looks ok
- Damage mechanics:
  - Will need to implement anyway and good way of testing targeting in a simple way, big todo
- Implement complex effects:
    - Need to deal with cloning, make sure stats are properly and easily cloned, maybe chain cloning from stat, chain inheritance too
    - Stat class, hashed & serialized, value + modifier, function that alters it
    - Unified treatment of stats
    - Remove Hp damage from readme, wont be serialized. Discuss, is damage a modifier? Token? could be...
      If so, this unifies deserialization and value
    - Add effect that buffs an entity stat, need few extra variables like how much and the buffed stat/relation
    - Also, add targeting, probably a random one or sth, play the test effect where a buff is applied
    - Tests:
        - Massive test case of all stat buffing/debuffing with the chosen proportion
        - Test case of targetting
    
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
