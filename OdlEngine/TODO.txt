Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
-Implementing Buffing/Debuffing:
	- In triginter, add effects that buff a stat for target(s)
        - Value (already there)
        - Stat to change (of target)
        - Type of buff (setting, addition, multiplication)
    - Tests:
        - Given: specific target(s): Massive test case of all stat buffing/debuffing with the chosen proportion, all stats, all situations
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
