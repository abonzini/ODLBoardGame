Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Rework graveyard:
	- It is not needed as coordinates are not stored anyway.
	- Just de-instantiate the same way a Unit is Instantiated.
	- If there's a need for reviving or keeping track, it can be added into player/board stats with a smaller overhead, just card or whatever.
	- Will need to modify GY test and reduce board and hash. Overall a positive change
- Combat
	- Resolve combat stage by obtaining first target of enemy
	- If a unit dies, HP check and board clean-up (kill unit)
	- Tests:
		- Unit clash but no death
		- Unit Attackign kills
		- Unit defending kills
		- Both units die
		- Tests regarding dead units in advancement list, such as middle unit dies, rest advances or stuff like that. Try to break unit list and see if all works
- Player damage and EOG
	- Having left the space for unit damaging enemy, implement it
	- Add the HP check as for unit
	- Create an "End of game exception" with proper handling in marching stage and card playing, process properly
	- Most importantly, need to EOG, and stay in this state
- Rush
	- Rush behaviour, flags and flag clean at beginning of turn
- Buildings
	- Buildings also summoned, more complex behaviour as BP are involved and only one building can be placed
		- Cards number -1000000000 to -1999999999 -> Playable token buildings, procedurally generated as 1-G-HP-[bPlain-bForest-bMountain](packed 18-bit binary, 4-6-8bit)-TGT
	- Bldg damage
- Stealth
- Implement cards, one by one, add tests, this involves more effects, implement an effect/auras/buff/token system, if/when and so on
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Todo...
	- Lots of individual mechanics that will be polished as it goes, individual card testing
