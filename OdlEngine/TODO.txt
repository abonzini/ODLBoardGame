Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- 4,5:
	- #4 and #5 as buildings with simple "on current tile" trigger. One asserts enemy, not in initial march and multiplies by 0. Other just filters ally and adds +1 to march
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
