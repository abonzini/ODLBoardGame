Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Card draw. Isolate the drawing of cards and fix so it returns of number of cards actually drawn in order to implement deckout properly and also to add as a triginter effect.
- March as effect 
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
