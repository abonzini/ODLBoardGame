Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Implement complex effects:
	- Buff tokens
	- Buff tok is just extra fields (hashable and serializable) on the placeable
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
