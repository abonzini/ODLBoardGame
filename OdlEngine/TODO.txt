Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
- TODO some tests:
    - Affected entity selection test (when there's an actual affecting event going on, such as construction, or whatever is implemented first)
    - Selection filtered (e.g. given a unit stepping on a building, and some tricky manual editing, prove that the unit/building/owner/opp filters in selection work ok)
