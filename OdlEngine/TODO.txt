To Keep in mind:
    - If there's "add cards to deck" or "add cards to hand" function, there'll need to be a parallel "discard pile".
    This "knowledge pile" exists for both hand and deck, in order to also deal with tutors. In UI, they may be seen by opp when looking at deck/hand icons, but also most importantly, used by the bot to determine chances on wildcard discovery (or certainties).
    Deck discovery is statistics-based as usual and the remaining deck is cloned & altered by knowledge pile and discard pile.
    Only needs to be done when cards are added or removed from deck/hand and not before. Cards that are shuffled into deck move all the hand knowledge into the deck knowledge pile (flush operation).
