Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Stealth
	- Stealth test cases:
	- Stealth properly interacting with effects that change boardstate besides the stealth unit effect
		- Stelath unit building
		- Stealth unit building stealt building
		- Stelath building being built period
		- On consturciton effect activated for stealth building
		- Building being skipped by stealth (non-existing) unit, built by another one in tile
		- Similarly, Building skipped by stealth (non-existing) unit, built by another unit but that unit activates effect
- Implement complex effects:
	- Events (when an effect occurs globally and triggers a unit, e.g. EOT). Loaded as dict <EventType, List<Entity>> of entities with the effect. This can be serialized, non-hashed.
	- Filters?
	---
	- Buff tokens
	- Buff tok is just extra fields (hashable and serializable) on the placeable
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Todo...
	- Lots of individual mechanics that will be polished as it goes, individual card testing
	- Ask yourself, how would this affect stealth?
