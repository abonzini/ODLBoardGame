Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Card maker UI:
	- import jsons. Missing only triginter and we good
- Implement rest of rulebook (start from scratch, use app)
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
