Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Player damage and EOG
	- Tests, for now all in advance:
		- Player is damaged but doesn't die
		- Unit reaches end but is interrupted by unit and doesn't hurt enemy
		- Player kills
		- Player overkills
		- 3 Separate units move towards, ABC:
			- If A kills, BC don't advance
			- If A doesn't, B does, C doesn't advance
			- Finally, C does, check all advanced 
- Rush
	- Rush behaviour, flags and flag clean at beginning of turn
- Buildings
	- Buildings also summoned, more complex behaviour as BP are involved and only one building can be placed
		- Cards number -1000000000 to -1999999999 -> Playable token buildings, procedurally generated as 1-G-HP-[bPlain-bForest-bMountain](packed 18-bit binary, 4-6-8bit)-TGT
	- Bldg damage
- Stealth
- Implement complex effects:
	- Buff tokens
	- Interactions (when placeable has absolute control of what's going on)
	- Events (when an effect occurs globally and triggers a unit, e.g. EOT)
	- Buff tok is multiple extra fields (hashable and serializable) on the placeable
	- Interactions are present in the unit, (hashable, serializable) also on placeable, will have a grammar-style description
	- Events too (hashable, serializable). THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH AN EVENT HANDLER IN THE STATE MACHINE, WHICH IS PROPERLY FILLED/EMPTIED WHEN PLACEABLE ENTERS/LEAVES !!!BUT!!! THEY'RE NOT SERIALIZED IN STATE MACHINE, INSTEAD GENERATED IN A LOADED GAME OR AS THINGS ARE PLACED
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Todo...
	- Lots of individual mechanics that will be polished as it goes, individual card testing
