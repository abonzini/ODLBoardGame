Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Card maker UI:
	- Load correct class from the card type selector, will later pop the rest of menus
	- In the middle of the process of drawing image, stats, according to class type
	- load image function
	- save image function
	- events and triggers rest of stuff
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
