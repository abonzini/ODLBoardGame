Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Card maker UI:
    - Save player features too (intiial gold, initial hp, initial active)
	- events and triggers rest of stuff
	- export json
	- import json
- Implement rest of rulebook (start from scratch, use app)
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
