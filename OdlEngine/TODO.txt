Ongoing tasks in order of priority:
- Multi-target input is ok but also may want to keep each target for many buffs, design and implement
- Implement rest of rulebook
	- Procedure:
		- Propose card, way to code it
		- Add triginters if not there already
		- No individual card testing! Game must be mechanically robust even if cards are completely revamped
